### About me
I went to Canada to study English and stayed there for about 3 years to graduate from high school. After coming back to Japan, I decided to work in Tokyo instead of entering a university since I wasn't interested in anything. However, I found something which could be my true calling there later on: computer programming. Currently, I'm studying computer science at the university of Ryukyu.

### Interests / What I can do
I can speak and somewhat write English.
I know how to make neural networks.
